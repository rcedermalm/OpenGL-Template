# OpenGL-template
A simple template for an OpenGL application. Created to make it easier to start off and play around with OpenGL.

The template contains the possibility to: 
* Create a window
* Load .obj files (The file needs to contain data for vertices, normals, texture coordinates and face information)
* Load and use TGA textures 

The creation of the window was implemented with the help of the website learnopengl.com. The loading of .obj and .tga files is written, with a few changes, by Stefan Gustavson (lecturer at Link√∂ping University) for a course in computer graphics.
